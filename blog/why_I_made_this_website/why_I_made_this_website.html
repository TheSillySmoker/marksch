        <h1>Why I made this website;<br> Why you should make one too </h1>
        <p>For years I have not regularly used Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat. 
        I have even gone so far as to permanently delete my Instagram account. 
        These are among the best decisions I have made in my life, and I implore you to do the same. 
        </p>
        <p>I believe the world is a better place with the internet around, I really do. 
        Those who disagree can go back to writing letters and see how much they enjoy the convenience. 
        In the early days of the internet, nearly all websites had a person behind them who put hours into each detail of their precious page. 
        Now, an avarice multi-deca-trillion-dollar industry controls it with the aim of squeezing every dollar out of you and the rest of us. 
        Most people want to share and see what's happening in their friend’s/family's lives on the internet. 
        Yes, there are many other use cases, but this is what social media aims to address. 
        Instead of this, we get belt-fed AI generated garbage or short-form media which has no benefit to us and yet, is increasingly addictive. 
        </p>
        <p>Facebook feeds are now mainly ads and garbage content you don’t care about, let's be honest. The only reason you go back is because you think you will miss something important. 
        Trust me, if it is important, you will hear about it, regardless. 
        </p>
        <p>The solution: code your own website from scratch, you will control everything from image quality to the layout, to button colours.    
        These days it is so easy to create a website, there are no barriers to starting today. 
        Use Google, ChatGPT, and w3schools to learn and it will set you free from the hands of big American tech. 
        </p>
        <p>This website currently costs me $10.44 a year. 
        This covers the domain name <a href="https://marksch.com">marksch.com</a> reservation, thats all you need.
        So no, this is not a Wix or Squarespace ad!
        </p>
        <p>Reach out if you have questions about making your own. 
        <br><br>
        I will be posting all kinds of things to this website. This is the best place to keep up to date with my life, so if you're interested, pop in occasionally :)
        <br>
