		<h1>My "Do Not Pay Off" List</h1>
		<p>
			I know you already know these things, but sometimes we need to hear them to make us realise that we are not actually doing them.
			Think of this as more of a public note to myself, rather than a sermon.<br><br>  
			So here it is, a basic list, in no particular order, of stuff to not pay off which will in-fact, pay off in the long run. <br>		
		
		<h2>1. Do not pay off reading</h2>
		<p>
			If you want to be a pro MLG at life, read / listen to books. Lots of them.
			I don't do this enough myself, however, it is the key to basically all useful knowledge. TikTok is not. Read and you will learn, simple.
			Exchange all your TikTok time for book reading time and your life will dramatically improve, trust me.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>2. Do not pay off sun pro</h2>
		<p> 
			Did you know Australia has one of the <b> highest rates of skin cancer in the world</b>?
			And about 2 out of 3 Australians will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer during their lifetime?
			(<a href="https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/skin-cancer/about-skin-cancer/">cancercouncil.com.au</a>)
			<br><br>
			This is INSANE and so <b>preventable</b>. <br>
			Check the 'UV index' on your phone and follow the instructions on when and how to protect yourself.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>3. Do not pay off dental</h2>
		<p>
			I am passionate about dental care. Brush more, go to the dentist, occasionally floss. This will pay dividends throughout your life.
			Also, if you're not using an electric toothbrush, you're doing it wrong, sort that out ASAP. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>4. Do not pay off financial education</h2>
		<p>
			You <i>can</i> become rich. Read some books on finance, become a gigachad saving / investing machine. Thank me later. 
			I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Strong-Money-Australia-Financial-Independence/dp/B0BQQ2RF8G?_encoding=UTF8&q

		<h2>5. Do not pay off eating well</h2>
		<p>
			Cut out as much sugar as possible. Less sweet things become sweeter when you do this (ever noticed plain milk is actually sweet?).<br><br>
			Make and eat real food.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>6. Do not pay off sleep</h2>
		<p>
			Sleep is perhaps the most important thing you do with your spare time. 
			Do more of it and make it consistent. This is a game changer for energy, vitality, etc. 
			If you find it hard to get to sleep at the same time every night, start waking up at the same time and the rest will look after itself.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>7. Do not pay off exercise</h2>
		<p>
			This one is simple, just exercise, it makes everything in life better.
		</p>
		<br>
			
		<br>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>
			I know this is super basic, that's kind of the point. Hopefully this can help you live a happier, healthier life. 
			Maybe you can make your own list and share it online, or <a href="https://marksch.com/contact.html">email it to me</a>, I would be interested in what you would have on yours. 
			Thanks for reading. See you in the next one.
