		<h1><a href="/home.html">Creep</a></h1>	
		<br>
		<p>
			The other day I was listening to Creep by Radiohead.
			The lyrics struck me with a sense of disappointment. How many people feel this way?<br>
			This is a fairly popular song so I assume many people are relating to the experience it describes. 
			If this is you, please read on. 
			<br> <br>
			The artist writing these lyrics clearly has been poisoned by soy and has lost his balls somewhere along the way.
			Lets go though some of the words and unpack how much of a weak pussy the author is and how he should change if he wants the girl he's singing about. 
			<br><br>
			<i>
				When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye
				<br><br>
			</i>
			Straight off the bat, this guy is too afraid to look into a womans eyes. Let's read on.
			<i>
				You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
				You float like a feather in a beautiful world<br>
				<br><br>
			</i>
			He is putting this girl on a pedistal, treating her as if she is royalty. 
			Women want to be treated like normal people dude! 
			This make you look weak.
			<br><br>
			<i>		
				I wish I was special, you're so fuckin' special
				<br><br>
			</i>
			Saying she is special and you are not shows that you do not value yourself.
			If you don't, why would she?
			You should talk and act as if you respect and value yourself and your time.
			The energy of a weak looser is just oozing!
			<i>
				But I'm a creep<br>
				I'm a weirdo<br>
				What the hell am I doin' here?<br>
				I don't belong here<br>
			</i>
