			The other day I was listening to Creep by Radiohead.
			The lyrics struck me with a sense of disappointment that so many would be feeling this way.

			The first verse and chorus go like this: 
			<q>
				When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye
				You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
				You float like a feather in a beautiful world
				I wish I was special, you're so fuckin' special
			</q>
			<q>
				But I'm a creep
				I'm a weirdo
				What the hell am I doin' here?
				I don't belong here
			</q>
		</p>
