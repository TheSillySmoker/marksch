		<p>
			The other day I was listening to Creep by Radiohead.
			The lyrics struck me with a sense of disappointment that so many would be feeling this way.

			The first verse and chorus go like this: 
			<blockquote>
			<i>
				When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye<br>
				You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry<br>
				You float like a feather in a beautiful world<br>
				I wish I was special, you're so fuckin' special<br>
			</i>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
			<i>
				But I'm a creep<br>
				I'm a weirdo<br>
				What the hell am I doin' here?<br>
				I don't belong here<br>
			</i>
			</blockquote>
