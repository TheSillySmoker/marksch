		<h1><a href="/home.html">Creep</a></h1>	
		<br>
		<p>
			The other day I was listening to Creep by Radiohead.
			The lyrics struck me with a sense of disappointment. How many people feel this way?<br>
			This is a fairly popular song so I assume many people are relating to the experience it describes. 
			If this is you, please read on. 
			<br> <br>
			The artist writing these lyrics clearly has been poisoned by soy and has lost his balls somewhere along the way.
			Lets go though some of the words and unpack how much of a weak pussy the author is and how he should change if he wants the girl he's singing about. 
			<br><br>
			<i>
				When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye
				<br><br>
			</i>
			Straight off the bat, this guy is too afraid to look into a woman's eyes. Let's read on.
			<br><br>
			<i>
				You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry<br>
				You float like a feather in a beautiful world
				<br><br>
			</i>
			He is putting this girl on a pedestal, treating her as if she is royalty. 
			Women want to be treated like normal people, dude! 
			This makes you look weak.
			Women often keep these male friend 'orbiters' around for convienience.
			They never date or sleep with them though!
			Whenever they need a favor, there is usually a pathetic weak male who is willing to wait hand and foot for them.
			In every single one of these cases, the male is hoping that if he does enough favors or if he is enough of a political ally, he might one day get sex. It won't work dude. 
			It's only when a confident, competent male comes along that there is any romantic interest. 
			<br><br>
			<i>		
				I wish I was special, you're so fuckin' special
				<br><br>
			</i>
			Saying that she is special and you are not shows that you do not value yourself.
			If you don't, why would she?
			Remember, your thoughts and speech shape your reality in real time.
			If you ever catch yourself thinking like this stop it immediately.
			It is the energy of a weak looser. 
			<br><br>
			<i>
				But I'm a creep<br>
				I'm a weirdo<br>
				What the hell am I doin' here?<br>
				I don't belong here<br>
				<br><br>
			</i>
			It is your birthright to belong. Adopt this mindset today and you will fit in. 
			The sad truth is that the sentiment of this song resonates with many young men. 
			These are the men who feel rejected by women and society, not realising that trying their hardest to be harmless nice guys is not a winning strategy. 
			It doesn't matter if you look like Brad Pitt, if you are weak around a woman, she will be disgusted by you. 
			This whole song wreaks of a weak man who is butt hurt and unsuccessful with women. 
			<br><br>
			The outro is filled with more of the same where he exalts and glorifies a woman just for her to run away. 
			<br><br>
			<i>
				Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want
				You're so fuckin' special, I wish I was special
				But I'm a creep
				I'm a weirdo
				What the hell am I doin' here?
				I don't belong here
				I don't belong here
			</i>
