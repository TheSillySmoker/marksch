		<h1><a href="/home.html">Creep</a></h1>	
		<br>
		<p>
			The other day I was listening to Creep by Radiohead.
			The lyrics struck me with a sense of disappointment. How many people feel this way?<br>
			This is a fairly popular song so I assume many people are relating to the experience it describes. 
			If this is you, please read on. <br> <br>
			The artist writing these lyrics clearly has been poisoned by soy and has lost his balls somewhere along the way.
			Lets go though some of the words and unpack how much of a weak pussy the author is and how he should change if he wants the girl he's singing about. <br><br>
			<i>
				When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye<br><br>
			</i>
			Straight off the bat, this guy is too afraid to look into a womans eyes. 
			Now though this is pretty much a universal experience for all men, it is imperitive that we overcome this fear.
			<i>
				You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry<br>
			</i>
				You float like a feather in a beautiful world<br>
				I wish I was special, you're so fuckin' special<br>
			</i>
			<i>
				But I'm a creep<br>
				I'm a weirdo<br>
				What the hell am I doin' here?<br>
				I don't belong here<br>
			</i>
