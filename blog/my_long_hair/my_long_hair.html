		<h2>My Long Hair</h2>
		<p>
			Whenever I tell people that havenâ€™t known me for 3+ years I had long hair, they are often perplexed as to how that would look on me. 
			This is for those people. 
			For better or worse, I had my hair down to my nipples at one stage. </p>

		<p>
			When it was time to cut it all off (Jan 2021), I decided it should go to a good cause. 
			I requested that the hairdresser make it into braids so that I could send it off to a foundation that makes wigs for sick people.

		<p>
			I highly recommend that you do this at lease once in your life time as a dude. Its super fun and a bit of a journey.
