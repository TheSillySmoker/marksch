			I have been buying Tesla stock since September 2020.
			In 2021 I decided to branch out and buy a few different shares. Diversification was never for me, glad I stopped early.  
			Please please please tell me that my strategy is too risky and that I should diversify! In a decades time, when I'm still holding, also make sure you tell me I got lucky.
			I'll say, yeah, I know, I bought Tesla stock over 100 times, that's very lucky because getting lucky 100 times in a row happens very often :D 
		</p>

			Jokes aside, I am very excited and optimistic for the future.
			I am certain we are heading towards energy abundance, ubiquitous sustainable autonomous transport, and billions of artificially intelligent robots building and maintaining our modern world. 
			I wonder if there is any company that is going after these 3 potentially multi-trillion dollar opportunities... 
			Some food for thought.
