			If you are male and do not lift heavy things, weather it be at the gym or work, you are doing it wrong.
			I don't know who needs to hear this, but take a long hard look in the mirror and tell yourself to start.

			Humans are not very good at understanding things in terms of exponentials or long term, you have to train yourself to be. 
			Understanding just one massive disruption in the market is all you need to make a life changing amount of money. 
			Investors get so caught up in short term BS that they can go their whole lives missing every single game changing opportunity that was right in front of their eyes. 
			Once you are able to think long term, the game is won. You can go through life with confidence, knowing that your financial life is sorted, allowing you to do what you really want.

			Very often the answer to your question is obvious; Occam's razor.
			When you ask yourself, will technology progress to the point where we don't need to drive cars manually any more? The obvious answer is yes.
			When you ask yourself, is the solution to self driving a rigid, rules based, heuristic approach or is it a highly adaptable, truly smart, real world artificial intelligence?
			The obvious answer is the latter.
			In the complex world we live, hard-coded rules are unable to adapt to it.
			It is only with the breakthrough of real world artificial intelligence that we can hope to understand and navigate its complexities without the human brain.
