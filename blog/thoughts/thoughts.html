		<h2>Thought of the day 11 MAY 2025</h2>
		<p>
			Very often the answer to your question is obvious; Occam's razor.
			When you ask yourself, will technology progress to the point where we don't need to drive cars manually any more? The obvious answer is yes.
			When you ask yourself, is the solution to self driving a rigid, rules based, heuristic approach or is it a highly adaptable, truly smart, real world artificial intelligence?
			The obvious answer is the latter.
			In the complex world we live, hardcoded rules are unable to adapt to it.
			It is only with the breakthrough of real world artificial intelligence that we can hope to understand and navigate its complexities without the human brain.
